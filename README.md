# mcgill-physics-faculty
This application is built with django. I make a layout for the McGill physics website. 
At its current state, it is very difficult to find a faculty member. This simple layout uses django, sql and the bootstrap v4.0

###To launch:
1) Download repository
2) pip install Django
3) python ./manage.py runserver
4) go to http://localhost:8000/
